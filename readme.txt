Our main Java code is xml.java
public class xml
{
{ main (method)
......Our code
....parsing
....query.execute
....ybus
}
complex (class called outside) for performing complex function

}
getconnection : (method) inside the class xml
{connection to sql
}
}

public class complex
{
a+b*i;
Referred Internet as We didnt have the math package for Ybus.
}

We are using mysql.connector(jar file) which is been added to the reference library.

Thanks & Regards
